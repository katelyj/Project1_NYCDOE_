## DESCRIPTION:

We envision a project that tries to accurately match the connection the weather has on oneâ€™s emotions through song. To accomplish this task, we plan to use both a weather API as well as a music streaming API, grabbing the location of a user to assist in choosing an appropriate song for the weather of that location. To assist our grand endeavours, we also plan on using the Google Maps API, getting the coordinates of the user through their location services. We plan to use a database in order to hold the location information for each city for maximum efficiency. In addition, we might allow users to create an account to keep track of weather and music combinations that they had in the past. We hope our project is a mindblowing experience.
